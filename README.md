CSE_385_Pokebase
================

Pokebase is a locally run pokedex application built by Drew, Kyle, Miranda, and Peter for CSE_385.

The Pokebase is licensed under the GPU GPL v2.0 license. See the license.txt file for details.

Introduction
================

The goal of the Pokebase is to be a quick and easy to use pokedex application for a desktop or laptop computer. We hope
that the Pokebase application can be used in conjunction with the core Pokemon games to provide a convenient way to reference
a particular pokemon and its attributes.
