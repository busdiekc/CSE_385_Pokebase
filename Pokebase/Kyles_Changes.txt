I will attempt to explain all of the changes that I have made to Pokebase. It has
been a few months so I might forget a thing here or there. If you have questions, ask 
me and I'll do my best to answer.

New_Pokebase.db
-----------------------------------------
So in order to handle the new mega pokemon and pokemon with various forms I had to rebuild our database with
a different schema. I've added an autoID attribute that auto-increments as you add tuples to the Pokemon, Sprite,
and Stat tables. Admittedly, having a separate autoID for each table isn't a good idea but that's what I did
3 months ago. It works because the information is entered into the database file from an array of Pokemon
objects which are always pulled from the website pokemondb.net in the correct order. 

As on now New_Pokebase.db is missing a good portion of information. It does not include any sprites or evolutions, 
and it does not have the pokemon linked to their respective habitat (habitatID is defaulted to -1 currently). These 
will be updated when I figure out how to pull all the sprites and evolutions from the internet so we aren't forced 
to manually enter in data for 700+ pokemon entries. 

Pokemon.java
------------------------------------------
This is just a simple class used for representing a pokemon and storing its respective data. All the information 
pulled from pokemondb.net get stored in a new pokemon object and is then stored in an array of all the pokemon.

WebsiteParser.java
------------------------------------------
This is the class that handles pulling information from the different webpages located at pokemondb.net. 
The tricky part was correctly putting the information parsed from the website into the right variables for storage 
because the different naming styles (mega, attack form, etc.) made it hell to easily know what data was where. For 
example, parsing Pikachu would yield an array with name, types, stats but parsing a mega pokemon would yield an 
array with name, mega, types, stats. I also discovered that not all of the mega evolutions are in the master pokedex 
list on pokemondb.net, some you have to click the specific pokemon to see their mega evolution (e.g. Swampert). With 
this in mind I do not guaruntee that I have correctly parsed the mega pokemon. I think I did a good job, but I can't 
be sure.

WebsiteParser now has three new methods: evolutionsParser(), spriteDownloader(), and saveSprite(). EvolutionsParser() 
successfully pulls the evolution chain information from the website and puts in the appropriate pokemon object from whom 
a pokemon evolves from and the method it evolves with. SpriteDownloader() successfully pulls the normal and shiny sprites 
of most of the pokemon from the website and using saveSprite() saves them to a common folder on my hard drive. I believe 
that all mega evolutions and various forms are skipped over because they are not presented in the list of pokemon on the 
webpage. Probably gonna have to add those in manually.

Running just this file currently prints out the ID, name, height, weight, type1, type2, and non-updated habitatID for 
every pokemon in the pokemonArray, which is all of them unless any mega evolutions have been skipped due to the problem 
stated above.

PutStuffInTheDatabase.java
-------------------------------------------
This class is responsible for taking the data stored in each pokemon in the pokemonArray and putting it in the database. 
There are currently methods for the pokemon table, the stats table, and the sprites table. 

Running just this file will parse the information by using WebsiteParser.java and then insert all the information 
obtained into the database.
